Pulse-Based Revenue Sharing Model
✅ Step 1: Unlock Monetization
One-time requirement: Reach Pulse Score ≥ 170 in any 20-day window.

Once unlocked, monetization is permanent.

📈 Step 2: Revenue % Scales with Pulse Tier
Pulse Score Tier	Tier Name	Revenue Share %	Notes
250+	Nova	90%	Elite creator
200–249	Surge	80%	Top-tier visibility
170–199	Pulse	70%	Monetization baseline
140–169	Shine	50%	Active but reduced
110–139	Glow	30%	Minimal share
< 110	Below Glow	10% or 0%	Monetized but very low %

💡 You can optionally set a minimum score (e.g., 100) below which revenue is paused, but this depends on how strict you want to be.

🎮 Example Walkthrough:
20-Day Period	Pulse Score	Monetized?	Revenue %
Day 1–20	175	✅ Yes	70%
Day 21–40	145	✅ Yes	50%
Day 41–60	210	✅ Yes	80%
Day 61–80	95	✅ Yes	10%

make the following changes :, on statistics page add an i button beside pulse score display the tier list (not messages only list and range), if a logged out (or not signed in user) tries to like a writing(content), then redirect it to login page,
a not signed in user can also view the profile (of other users) but cannot follow
make all these changes without affecting the other working things.
