1. Security
Checklist:
[ ] Set a strong, secret SECRET_KEY in your environment variables (not in code).
[ ] Ensure all forms use CSRF protection (Flask-WTF).
[ ] Validate and sanitize all user input (forms, file uploads, query params).
[ ] Use HTTPS in production (get an SSL certificate, configure Nginx/Apache).
[ ] Set secure cookie flags in your config:
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
[ ] Never log or display sensitive information (passwords, tokens).
[ ] Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy ORM does this by default).
[ ] Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
2. Deployment
Checklist:
[ ] Prepare a requirements.txt or Pipfile with all dependencies.
[ ] Use Gunicorn or uWSGI as your WSGI server.
[ ] Set up Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy (serves static files, handles SSL).
[ ] Store all secrets and config in environment variables (use .env and python-dotenv for local dev).
[ ] Set FLASK_ENV=production and DEBUG=False in production.
[ ] Set up a process manager (systemd, supervisor, or Docker) to keep your app running.
[ ] Test deployment on a staging server before going live.
3. Performance
Checklist:
[ ] Add database indexes for foreign keys and frequently queried fields (check Alembic migrations).
[ ] Use Flask-Caching or Redis for caching expensive queries or pages.
[ ] Compress and resize images before upload/display (use Pillow or similar).
[ ] Minify and bundle CSS/JS (use Flask-Assets, Webpack, or online tools).
[ ] Serve static files via Nginx or a CDN.
[ ] Enable Gzip compression on your web server.
4. User Experience
Checklist:
[ ] Test all pages on mobile, tablet, and desktop (use Chrome DevTools and real devices).
[ ] Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels).
[ ] Provide clear navigation (FAQ, About, Contact, etc. are easy to find).
[ ] Use loading spinners and feedback messages for actions (already present in your templates).
[ ] Add tooltips or help text where users might get confused.
[ ] Make error messages user-friendly and actionable.
5. Monitoring & Logging
Checklist:
[ ] Set up Python logging (log errors, warnings, and important events to a file).
[ ] Integrate an error monitoring service (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.).
[ ] Set up email alerts for critical errors (optional).
[ ] Schedule regular database and file backups (use cron jobs or your hosting provider’s tools).
[ ] Monitor server health (CPU, RAM, disk space).
6. Legal & Compliance
Checklist:
[ ] Review and update your Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages.
[ ] Ensure users can delete their accounts and data (already implemented).
[ ] Clearly state how user data is used and stored.
[ ] Add a cookie consent banner if required by your region.
7. SEO & Analytics
Checklist:
[ ] Use descriptive <title>, <meta name="description">, and Open Graph tags on all pages.
[ ] Generate and submit a sitemap.xml to Google Search Console.
[ ] Add robots.txt to control search engine crawling.
[ ] Integrate Google Analytics or another analytics tool.
[ ] Use semantic HTML (headings, lists, etc.) for better SEO.
8. Testing
Checklist:
[ ] Manually test all user flows (register, login, write, comment, unlock, etc.).
[ ] Write unit tests for critical backend logic (use pytest or unittest).
[ ] Test error cases (invalid input, unauthorized access, etc.).
[ ] Test on different browsers and devices.
9. Documentation
Checklist:
[ ] Update your README.md with setup, deployment, and usage instructions.
[ ] Document environment variables and configuration options.
[ ] Add a “Help” or “Getting Started” section for new users (could be in FAQ/About).
[ ] Comment your code where logic is complex or non-obvious.
